# GoOut
Go Out is a mobile application developed for the simple purpose of connecting its users to local events and special activities happening around their area. We have developed an application for smart phones that allows any individual to find local events and specials that are happening around their area. Anything from concerts, farmerâ€™s markets, car shows, comedy events, community events, sporting events, lunch deals and more can be found on the app. 
We have created a server of data that aggregates information on public events from multiple sources and is presented to a user on a single app. Our database has thousands of events for users of all types and ages. Our database is a crucial component to our app since it directly influences our users experience on the app.
